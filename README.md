# Operation Monkey
A project I created for my OCR A-Level Computer Science NEA.

Operation Monkey is a game built primarily using python's pygame libary and various object-orientated techniques.

## What is it?
### What's the context of the game?
In Operation Monkey, a monkey called Atlas, who happens to have the highest IQ ever recorded on a mammal has been kidnapped by a sinister group who intend to perform unethical and cruel experiments on his brain, potentially leading to his death. Due to Atlas' involvement with the military, it is your job as a soldier to go and save him.

In order to save him, you need to eliminate 40 soldiers and 5 tanks using the weapons provided to you. it's essentially a first person shooter where the player has to aim their weapon at the enemies whilst he's moving on a tank himself. Operation Monkey is inspired by the game "Operation Wolf".
