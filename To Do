TO DO:
-Bugs: When enemy is flashing (shooting), I sometimes cannot kill it with the uzi gun, however when I throw grenade it works.
-Bugs: Sometimes, when the enemy stops shooting at me, it moves off with another soldier "stuck" to him. The soldier "stuck" is not usually animating, whereas the actual soldier is animating.
-Improvement: implement logic so that the enemy moves without bumping into each other.
