Stage 5 Difficulties:
Stage 5.1(Creating the player class), I did not have any coding difficulties, I just found it difficult to think about how the infrastructure will work. (what methods and attributes I need).
Stage 5.2(Creating the weapon class), I had a lot of difficulties with the bullets, I did not know where to store the bullets as when I shot, the bullet count would go to 99 and then back to 100, I realised I was creating an object in the main loop so my code was getting repeated. Therefore I fixed this by creating an object outside the loop. Another issue was that the bullets were firing too fast, therefore I created logic which relies on the clock, to add a cooldown.
